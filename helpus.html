<font size=3 face="arial"><b>Our vision</b> is that every missing person is found safe. We are here to 
ensure that anyone who is missing can find a safe way to reconnect with a loved one, to get a message home, or, to get to a place of safety 
and that families are supported whilst they live with not knowing what has happened to someone they love.
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size=3 face="arial">You can always help us to find the missing peoples by registering yourself as an user. As an user, you can comment 
and provide any information on other missing peoples' picture shown to you in the timeline. 
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size=3 face="arial">Further, you can also apply to volunteer in our site.

<font size=3 face="arial">If you are a valid NGO, you can also register yourself and help us to find those missing and bring them back to 
their families and loved ones.
