which is dedicated to bringing missing children and adults back together with their families. Some missing people you will have 
heard of, but many more you won’t. For their families, life can feel like a desperate and unbearable struggle as they wait for days or 
even years. That’s why we are here for missing people and their families, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to provide free and 
confidential support.

and their families to explore their options and, where possible, to reconnect. We listen in confidence, and support missing people and 
their families to explore their options and, where possible, to reconnect. For those left behind, we provide specialised support to ease the 
heartache and confusion, and help search for their missing loved ones. We make every effort to ensure that the support and information 
we provide is accurate and appropriate. We also signpost to other Non Governmental Organization as part of the services we offer and 
we always strive to ensure that the referrals we make are appropriate and to reputable organisations. However we cannot accept liability 
for the actions of any other services we may signpost you to.

and that families are supported whilst they live with not knowing what has happened to someone they love.
