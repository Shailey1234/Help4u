# Help4u
Portal for registering missing people across the nation. It had two sides, one was to register NGOs who can help in searching these people
and another to register missing people from their near and dears. This portal helps missing people family to contact with different valid 
NGO’s at once so that NGO’s can help them. It contained Notifications belt in case there comes comments/leads/NGO acceptance of the missing
person for the End User and also on their own Timeline, they can visit missing people who are suspected to be in their area.
And an opportunity to give back the society by helping us in order to find missing people by volunteering yourself.
 Admin will manage the activities of NGOs, and Volunteers. The complains will be processes by NGOs and the assignment jobs will be given to 
Volunteers. The Notifications will also be updated to maintain a record and NGOs will close the case by contacting the complainee about
the missing person.
