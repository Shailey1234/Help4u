<font size=5 face="times new roman" color="38acec">Policy Statement</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size=3 face="arial">All individuals are responsible for safeguarding their system access login and password credentials and must comply 
with the password parameters and standards identified in this policy. Passwords must meet the complexity requirements outlined 
and must not be shared with or made available to anyone in any manner that is not consistent with this policy and procedure.
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size=5 face="times new roman" color="38acec">Reason for Policy</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size=3 face="arial">Assigning unique user logins and requiring password protection is one of the primary safeguards employed 
to restrict access to the help4u network and the data stored within it to only authorized users. If a password is 
compromised, access to information systems can be obtained by an unauthorized individual, either inadvertently or maliciously. 
Individuals registered are responsible for safeguarding against unauthorized access to their account, and as such, must conform 
to this policy in order to ensure passwords are kept confidential and are designed to be complex and difficult to breach. The parameters 
in this policy are designed to comply with legal and regulatory standards.
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size=5 face="times new roman" color="38acec">Entities Affected by this Policy</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size=3 face="arial">help4u and affiliates with any type of help4u system access.
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size=5 face="times new roman" color="38acec">Who Should Read this Policy</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size=3 face="arial">All individuals registered for accessing help4u site.
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size=5 face="times new roman" color="38acec">Password Requirements</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size=3 face="arial">The following parameters indicate the minimum requirements for passwords for all individual accounts 
where passwords are:
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size=3 face="arial">
<ul type="square">
<li>  At least six(6) characters in length. </li>
<li>  English upper-case letters(A-Z). </li>
<li>  English lower-case letters(a-z). </li>
<li>  One or more numerical digits(0-9).</li>
<li>  Non-alphanumeric or special characters(such as ` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ + - = { } | \ : " ; ' < > ? , . / and space).</li>
<li>  Not be based on anything that somebody could easily guess or obtain using individual related information.</li>
</ul>
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size=5 face="times new roman" color="38acec">Password Expiration</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size=3 face="arial">In order to prevent an attacker from making use of a password that may have been discovered, passwords 
are deemed temporary and must be changed regularly. ITS Security reserves the right to reset a userâ€™s password in the event a 
compromise is suspected or reported. The required frequency at which passwords must be changed varies based on the type of user, 
as defined below:-

<ul type="square">
<li><b>Standard Users</b></li>
<p>
<font size=3 face="arial">Standard users consist of help4u users and members that are not system administrators.
<ul type="circle">
<li>    Passwords must be changed every six (6) months.</li>
<li>    Passwords must not be reused for at least four (4) generations.</li>
<li>    Passwords must not be changed more than one (1) time per day.</li>
<li>    At least four (4) characters must be changed when new passwords are created.</li>
<li>    New passwords must comply with the password requirements defined in the previous section.</li>
</ul>
</font>
</p>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
<li><b>Privileged Users</b></li>
<p>
<font size=3 face="arial">Privileged users consist of users with administrator access and these accounts are at a higher risk for compromise.
<ul type="circle">
<li>    Passwords must be changed every ninety (90) days.</li>
<li>    Passwords must not be reused for at least six (6) generations.</li>
<li>    Passwords must not be changed more than one (1) time per day.</li>
<li>    At least four (4) characters must be changed when new passwords are created.</li>
<li>    New passwords must comply with the password requirements defined in the previous section.</li>
